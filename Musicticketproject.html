<p>
    Please understand that attending a concert or opera is different from watching TV or film.
Please remember what listening to a concert or an opera is a group event, you are enjoying a communal experience so be sympathetic to your neighbours.
Please do not talk, or comment of everything you like or dislike, other patrons may not appreciate your comments or might prefer to listen to the music in silence.
Please do not wave or try to catch the attention of people you know who are performing, particularly during the performance itself. It is off putting for performers and audience members alike.
Please do express your approbation, but wait until the music has finished. It can be seen as discourteous to performers to show noisy enthusiasm whilst they are still performing, no matter how spontaneous.
